Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. 
They are useful for 
1)managing asynchronous code 
2)Allowing for more readable and structured handling of async tasks. 3)Avoiding callback hell.
4)Enabling better error handling through chaining methods like `then()`, `catch()`, and `finally()`.
