The answer will be TypeError: employeeId is not a function


The output of this code will be:

```
TypeError: employeeId is not a function


1. 'employeeId' is initially declared as a string 'abc123'.
2. The 'foo' function is defined.
3. Inside 'foo', there's a function declaration with the same name 'employeeId'.
4. When `foo' is, it trying to execute `employeeId()` as a function.
5. However, before 'foo' executes, it encounters the function declaration of 'employeeId' inside 'foo'.
6. Due to JavaScript's hoisting behavior, the function declaration 'function employeeId() { console.log(typeof employeeId); }' is hoisted onto the top of the 'foo' function.
7. Therefore, when employeeId() is called inside 'foo', it refers to the local 'employeeId' function, not the global variable 'employeeId' that holds the string 'abc123'.
8. Since the local 'employeeId' function is not assigned any value or functionality and is called as a function, it throws a 'TypeError' stating that 'employeeId is not a function.
